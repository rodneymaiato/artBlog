I'm Rodney.

I draw, sketch, paint, and play a few musical instruments. I love all mediums of art in audio or visual forms.

I still draw, paint and play guitar, and I can't imagine giving it up.

I grew up in the great city of Montreal, Quebec and was blessed to have been immersed in the French culture. Later in life, I moved to the west coast and I'm grateful to be experiencing that too.

In elementary school, I loved anything to do with art. I always loved music, and I was lucky that my grade 5 teacher gave up some of her free time to give me the three guitar lessons that spawned a lifetime of musical enjoyment.
