I'm Rodney.

I create art and play musical instruments, with a deep appreciation for expression over commercial success. 

Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, I cherish my French cultural roots. I now reside on the west coast, embracing new experiences. From a young age, I was drawn to art and music, receiving guitar lessons in fifth grade that ignited my lifelong passion for music.
