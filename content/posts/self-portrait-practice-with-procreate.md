Getting better with every practice session!

When I kick back on the couch post-work, it's a no-brainer to grab my iPad, fire up Procreate, slap on a reference photo, and just roll with it.

Procreate's got some cool perks, like flipping your work around in a flash and checking it out in grayscale real quick.

I'm all about painting over mistakes instead of hitting that undo button â€“ it's all part of the journey, right?

Here's the same image in grayscale.
